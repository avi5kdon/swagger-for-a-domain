This is a simple web application that enables a swagger UI.

you can build this by using:

mvn clean install 

Then you can deploy the war (generated in target/) in any webserver and access the swagger UI

For example: 

http://localhost:8181/swagger-web?url=/cxf/crm/swagger.json

Here, the url parameter is the url for the Swagger API json file
